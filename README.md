##Roadmap of Future Enhancement

###Feature 1: Use a line to link squares
To implement this feature I first need to understand how to draw a line diagonal or at the middle of squares
Replace the logic for drawing a line instead of coloring the squares with yellow

##Feature 2: Enhance the layout and UI design of the game
To enhance it we may use bootstrap.
